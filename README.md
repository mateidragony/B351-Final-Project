# B351 Introduction to AI Final Project

This project demonstrates our knowledge of different machine learning models and training them in a custom Unity state space. This repo is based off of the [Unity-Technologies ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) repo.

## Build Steps

More detailed steps for getting started with ml-agents can be found [here](https://unity-technologies.github.io/ml-agents/).
1. Install the newest version of [Unity](https://unity.com/download).
2. Install the newest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Clone this repository

Once you have downloaded these,

1. Install the ```com.unity.ml-agents``` Unity package
2. Install the ```mlagents-envs``` and ```mlagents``` Python packages

Now, you are ready to start training a model, or testing a already trained model

1. Open Project folder in Unity as a Unity Project
2. Open the B351 Scene

You will see multiple state spaces with many different **Agents**. The **Agents** are the rolling balls. When you open the project, the agents will have already been trained. To see the **Agents** in action, just press play and watch them go!

If you want to start training your own model, I suggest following the tutorial [here](https://unity-technologies.github.io/ml-agents/), as it is very in depth and easy to follow.

## Where to find our source code
Our own model that we created can be found under the ```Our Model``` folder in the repo.
\
The Unity state space that we created can be found under the ```Project``` folder in the repo.

The other folders were pulled from the [Unity-Technologies ml-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) repo, and are needed to train and run the models that we created and trained.
